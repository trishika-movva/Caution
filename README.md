Inspiration

Caut!on is an app meant to be your intuitive travel companion. Explore the downtown area with a map that gives you the ability to personalize your atmosphere. Feel the beat of the city and follow its rhythm, whether it means exploring bustling areas for a lively atmosphere or discovering a secret spot for peaceful reflection. More than just an app, Caut!on connects you to the locations that suit your preferences and mood, acting as your own personal guide to the city of Athens. Allow spontaneity to flourish and allow Caut!on to work with you to craft unique experiences.

What it Does

Caut!on is an innovative app set to transform your experience of Athens' downtown. Fundamentally, Caut!on is a dynamic mapping tool that shows users how crowded a given area is depending on the average traffic of the area at a given range of times. It allows users to report any unsafe incidents so that other users can be aware. If a user feels unsafe, they can seek out a more social location using the map. The app surpasses a conventional map in that it recognizes and accommodates your need for social contact or privacy.

How we built it

We used Figma to create a visual representation of Caut!on along with Eclipse for the code.

Challenges we ran into

Creating the map was a difficulty due to our unfamiliarity with interactive components. 
There was also a lack of public data on the number of people that visit each social space at a given time and so we had to estimate. 

Accomplishments that we’re proud of

Going into this Hackathon, we weren't sure if we could finish a project in the given time constraint given our lack of prior Hackathon experience. However, successfully finishing this project gave us a boost of confidence and proved that we could create a cutting-edge application with widespread utility in a short period. 

What we learned

We learned how to use Figma to prototype our app.

What’s next for Caut!on?

We plan to expand Caut!on to consider every day of the week as it currently only gives population density on Fridays. We will also expand the number of places that the app can access. We want to include a user-driven rating system where users can rate the accuracy of the information provided by the app so that we can make the app more accurate. Caut!on can one day have the ability to act as a form of social media where people can chat with one another to meet up at certain places depending on if they’re looking for a quiet or sociable space. This app will not just be a utility but a social hub fostering connections and signaling safe spaces.
